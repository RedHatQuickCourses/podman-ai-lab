== Workshop Environment for Red Hat Associates

Red Hat associates can use the Red HatÂ® Demo Platform to provision a Podman Desktop environment.

Use the https://demo.redhat.com/catalog?search=podman&item=babylon-catalog-prod%2Fsandboxes-gpte.rhel-podman-desktop.prod[Getting Started with Podman Desktop,window=_blank] catalog item from Red Hat Demo Platform (RHDP).

[NOTE]
The Workshop deploys an AWS instance with the RHEL 9.4 desktop operating system installed.  The lastest version of Podman Desktop can be access through the activities menu. You will need to install the AI lab extension.  While playground, services, and model catalog environments function well; performance is limited for recipe catalog applications. 


When ordering this demo item:

* Select `Practice/Enablement` for the `Activity` field, and `Learning about the product` for the `Purpose`.

* If you have a Salesforce ID for a customer sales opportunity, then copy it to the `Salesforce ID` field. Otherwise, leave the field blank.

* In the `Region` field, select the region closest to your geographic area.

* Review the auto-stop and auto-destroy timers. You can change these later after classroom provisioning by opening a ticket with the RHDP team.
