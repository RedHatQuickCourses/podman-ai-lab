= Create Podman Machine

Before using the services available in Podman AI Lab, a Podman machine needs to be set up to provide cpu, memory, & storage resources.  In this use case a virtualized container instance on the desktop or laptop hardware.

If the Podman machine is not running, you will see the following message in most AI Lab resources.

== Initialize and start Podman

To start working with containers, Podman needs to be initialized.

 * Podman desktop will automatically install the latest version of Podman with Podman extention

 * From the Podman Desktop dashboard, return the extentions menu

 * Insure the Podman Extension is installed, if not install it now

 * Start the extention and verify it is active

[NOTE]
From this same menu we can start the Podman machine by clicking play, this will create a container running without customizing the resources needed to run the Podman AI resources. This machine is optimized to run containers and micro service applications, is *NOT* properly sized to host the resources needed for AI Model inference in Podman AI Lab.  Instead use the customized Podman machine instructions below.

== Create a custom Podman Instance

In order to host AI Models, we going to need a container with a minimum of 5Gb of memory, 4 vCPUs, and 10GB of storage space.  For best experience during the lab, a podman machine with 5 vCPUs, 12GB of memory, and 20GB of storage is recommended.
 
 . Open Podman Desktop dashboard

 . Click on settings from the navigation menu, it's the gear icon at the bottom left.

+
 . Click *create new Podman machine* (the button may show as create new) or if a machine is already running, stop then delete the machine. Then click create new.



 . Optionally change the machine name, if you plan to host multiple AI applications at once.

 . For the vCPUs, you can leave the default of 5
 
 . Change the memory to at least 8GB recommended, 12-16GB if possible.

 . For the drive space, reduce the amount to 20-40GB  ( this is not where AI models are stored).

 . Leave the defaults for the other options. 

 . Click Create

It should take a short time for the Podman machine to become ready, which is indicated by the resource meters and Running under the machine name.

With our compute resources ready to go, N\wow is time to get working with AI. 

Let's being to explore the features of Podman AI Lab.
