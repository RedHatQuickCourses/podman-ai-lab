= Create Podman Machine

Before using the services available in Podman AI Lab, a Podman machine needs to be set up to provide CPU, memory, & storage resources.  In this case, a virtualized container instance on the desktop or laptop hardware.

If the Podman machine is not running, you will see the following message in most AI Lab resources.

== Initialize and Start Podman

To start working with containers, Podman needs to be initialized.

Podman desktop will automatically install the latest version of Podman. 

From the Podman Desktop dashboard: Ensure the Podman Extension is now installed from the extensions menu.

From the Podman menu or widget section, click to install or initialize Podman.

From this same menu you can also start the Podman machine, which will create a container running virtually to host the resources needed to run the Podman AI resources.

However, this machine, while optimized to run containers and applications, is properly sized to host the resources needed for AI model inference.

== Create a custom Podman Instance

 
Open Podman Desktop dashboard.

Click on "Settings" from the navigation menu (it's the gear icon at the bottom left).

Click *Create new Podman machine* (the button may show as "Create New"). If a machine is already running, stop and delete the machine. Then click "Create New".



 . Optionally change the machine name if you plan to host multiple AI applications at once.

 . For the vCPUs, you can leave the default of 5.
 
 . Change the memory to at least 8GB (12-16GB is recommended if possible).

 . For the drive space, reduce the amount to 20-40GB  (this is not where downloaded models are stored).

 . Leave the defaults for the other options. 

 . Click "Create".

It should take a short time for the Podman machine to become ready, which is indicated by the resource meters and "Running" under the machine name.
