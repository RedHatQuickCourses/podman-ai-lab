== Our Fictional Company - ABC Corp

ABC Corp is a forward-thinking organization that has recognized the potential of AI to revolutionize their web interfaces. To capitalize on this opportunity, they have decided to integrate AI models into their existing interfaces using chatbots. However, the developer in charge of this project lacks experience with AI models and products.

The course begins by following along with the Developer's progression to understand Podman, Podman Desktop, and finally the installation of the AI Lab Extionsion.

After successful installation of Podman AI Lab, we continue by exploring various AI models in the Playground feature, gaining a deeper understanding of their capabilities and limitations.  

Next, the developer leverages Model Services to interact with code examples for AI models. This hands-on experience allows them to see how these models can be integrated into real-world applications

Once the developer has a solid foundation in AI model interaction, they use an existing Recipe to deploy a sample chatbot application. This recipe serves as a blueprint, guiding the developer through the process of integrating the AI model into the web interface.

The initial demo may not meet response expectations, leading the developer to retrain the AI model using the InstructLab project and fine-tune it with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 
 
By the end of the course, students (aka developers) will have practical experience integrating AI models into applications, optimizing them for specific use cases, and delivering an exceptional user experience.
