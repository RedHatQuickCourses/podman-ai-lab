== Evaluating AI Models

The GizmoGobbleâ€™s leadership team decided that, when it comes to LLM development, they would exhaust the path of least custom development before moving to more complicated and costly approaches.

These are the requirement that they set forth:

 * Develop first using existing open-source large language models (LLMs). 

 * Iterate through multiple LLMs to determine which one best fits the use case.

 * Apply prompt engineering techniques against the LLM.

 * Once you find the LLM that works best, focus on that LLM

 * Utilize multiple LLMs depending on the task.

 * Fine-tune an LLM with custom data.


Now, let's explore Podman AI considering the above GizmoGobble Corporation requirements to help us understand how Podman AI Lab can be used to kick-start AI-enabled application development.
