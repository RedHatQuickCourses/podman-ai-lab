== Evaluating AI Models

The GizmoGobbleâ€™s leadership team decided when it comes to LLM development, exhaust the path of least custom development before moving to more complicated and costly approaches.

These are the requirement they forth:

 * Develop first using existing open source large language models (LLMs) 

 * Iterate through multiple LLMs to determine which one best fits the use case.

 * Apply prompt engineering techniques against the LLM.

 * Once you find the LLM that works best, focus on that LLM

 * Fine tune a LLM with custom data.

Now let's explore Podman AI considering the above GizmoGobble Corporation requirements to help us understand how Podman AI Lab can be used to kick-start AI enabled application development.
