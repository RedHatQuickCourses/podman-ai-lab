= Recipe Catalog

== Recipes catalog overview

One of the most important features of the Podman AI Lab extension is the curated catalog of open source recipes that enable you to navigate common AI use cases and solutions. 

To begin, click the top left option in the sidebar to open the Recipes Catalog. This catalog is organized by categories of example use cases that can inspire you on how to infuse your app with AI, with pre-selected models (and the ability to swap), example code, and easy access to your IDE. Browse through the list and find the recipe that best suits your needs. The catalog of recipes is provided to provide the best practices and inspire you with use cases you can eventually benefit from in your applications. 

Once you've selected a recipe from the Recipes Catalog, you'll be able to see a summary of what the recipe does and how it works. This will give you a better understanding of the recipe's capabilities and help you decide if it's right for your application. You’ll also find handy links to the application source code and the recommended model, as well as the ability to select other compatible models (curated from Hugging Face’s open source community). 

When you're ready to see the application live and running, you can start it by clicking the Start AI App button on the upper right-hand side. As the application starts, you'll be able to see the model it uses and where the source code of the application is located. In the background, Podman is running an inference server for the downloaded model within a container using the freely redistributable Red Hat Enterprise Linux Universal Base Image.

During the startup process, you'll be shown a few steps that will be completed before the application is ready to use. These steps might include downloading the model, building the container images with the model and the application, etc.

Once the application has started, you can open it from the UI and use it from your web browser. In the chatbot example, we’re able to interact with the front end application, which is inferencing the model server, the selected Mistral-7B model. It’s this easy to set up a model server and start integrating generative AI in your applications.

As you work in other areas of Podman Desktop for your container workflow, you’ll always be able to see your running AI apps (i.e., the recipes you started) in the dedicated Running section for Podman AI Lab.

=== Recipes catalog sample applcations

Podman AI Lab ships with a so-called Recipes Catalog that helps you navigate a number of core AI use cases and problem domains such as Chat Bots, Code Generators and Text Summarizers. Each recipe comes with detailed explanations and sample applications that can be run with various large language models (LLMs). Experimenting with multiple models allows finding the optimal one for your use case.

*natural language processing*

 * *Chatbots* that simulate human conversation, using AI to comprehend user inquiries and offer suitable responses. These capabilities are often used to augment applications that provide self-service customer support or virtual personal assistance.
 * *Text summarizers*, which provide versatile capabilities across many applications and industries, where they can deliver effective and efficient information management. Using this recipe, developers can build applications to assist with things like content creation and curation, research, news aggregation, social media monitoring, and language learning.
 * *Code generators*, which empower developers to concentrate on higher-level design and problem-solving by automating repetitive tasks like project setup and API integration, or to produce code templates.
 * *RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)*, is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response.
 
*computer-vision* 

 * *Object detection* helps identify and locate objects within digital images or video frames. It is a fundamental component in various applications, including autonomous vehicles, retail inventory management, precision agriculture, and sports broadcasting.
 
*audio* 

 * *Audio-to-text* transcription involves the process of automatically transcribing spoken language into written text, facilitating documentation, accessibility, and analysis of audio content.

*multimodel* 

 * *Image understanding* upload an image file from your host machine and the app will provide a natural language description of the image.


== LAB: Sample Application Deployment

Located in the AI Apps section of AI Lab is the Reciept Catalog, along with the Running menu option. 

When opened the recipe catalog display the sample appllications sorted by use case. 

Let's begin with the ChatBot Appliation.

 .  Select the ChatBot application open a new dashboard with two options, the Summary & Models tab.

 .. The Summary display details about the application.   
 .. The Models tab allows the user to select a compatbile model for the applcation to use.  
 
 . Depending on the available resources in your Podman container running in podman desktop, you may receive a notification about increaseing available resource to improve performance. 

 .. If you did receive this message, close out of the previous resources and restart your podman container

 .. Or increase the resources available in your podman container for a pleasant lab experience. 

 . On right side of the window, will be the AI App Details section with a button to start the AI App.

 .. In the Model Section, there is a drop down to allow the user to select an alternative Model

 .. Also shown is the Repository location for the ai lab recipes where the original applicaiton files are located

 . Click the Start AI App to launch the applicaiton. 

 .. If you use a model other than the default, you will need to use the running menu to view and launch the application in a new web browser.





If you used the default AI Model, then you will get a checklist of the progress during the application deployment.

Additionally, from the AI App Details sub-menu, there will also be options to open the application in a web browser, restart the application, and delete the application. 

the application can be launch in a web browser to inact with the model via Chat.

This seems exactly like the playground, the difference is the playground interaction happens within the Podman Desktop application while the Recipe is launch using external web service that connect to the model via the interence endpoint. 

Another difference is this user experience so there are no tuning parameter options provided, or system propmt as those will be set in the background by the developer and stay consistent across users.

=== Podman Desktop 

We can use the containers menu of podman desktop to view the running container that make up this application.

 * There is a container for the streamlit chat application

 * There is a container for the llama.cpp server hosting the AI Model

 * There is a container for ???

In Pod section of Podman Desktop, the Pod that contains the three container is displayed

 .  view the kubernetes deployment

 . view the log files

 . view the summary of containers running in the pod


=== Additional applications

Each of the additional Recipe's available will launch a service to allow the user to develop experience with a specific business case for AI Model development. 

There a video walkthrough of each of the additional Recipe's in action.

In between each, delete the previous recipe, restart the podman container to expereince the best Podman AI lab performance.
