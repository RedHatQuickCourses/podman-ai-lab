== AI Models

Podman AI Lab provides a curated list of open source AI models and LLMs. Once downloaded, the models are available to be used for AI applications, model services and playgrounds. 

There are four tabs availble in the Models Catalog

 * *All* - display all available catalog models, whether downloaded or available is indicated by the model icon being highlighted in green for downloaded models.
 * *Downloaed* - displays all models that have been store locally for offline use. 
 * *Imported* - displays any models imported that were not originally listed in the catalog
 * *Available* - display all catalog models that have not been downloaded.

Check license and required resources. Import your own models.

=== From the Models section 

You can select to download one or more of the pre-curated models available in the AI Lab.

These models all fall under the apache 2.0 license. 

[NOTE]
The Apache 2.0 license is a particular type of open-source, permissive software license that ensures that end-users are granted a license to any patent that is covered by the software in question. An Apache 2.0 license ensures the security and availability of safe and powerful open-source software.

=== Download a model from the Models Catalog 

 . Open the Podman Desktop Application

 . Ensure the Podman AI Lab extention is active from the extentions menu dashboard

 . Select the AI Lab menu icon to open the AI Lab dashboard

 . Select the Models / Catalog menu from the navaigation menu. 

 . Select the instrublab/granite-7b-lab-GGUF model file by clicking the name to view details about the AI Model. 
+

This usually includes details about the model creator, original model location, and a description with additional details about the AI Model. For specific details on the model, visit: https://huggingface.co/instructlab/granite-7b-lab[huggingface hub model card for the Granite-7b-Lab]. 

 . Return the catalog dashboard and use the DownArrow icon on the far right to start the download of the instructlab/granite-7b-lab-GGUF file.

 . Download any additional model files you are interested in working with. 

In order the Model to be availble to the Services and Playground environments, it must be visible in the download tab of the Model Catalog. 

===  Importing an InstructLab trained model into Podman AI Lab
Speaking of importing and working with trained models, let’s take a look at working with an InstructLab-based fine-tuned model. While LLMs are trained on immense amounts of data in a variety of subjects, the InstructLab approach allows you to fine-tune a model on knowledge and skills for specific use cases, and brings true open source to AI model development. What’s neat is that this is possible on consumer-grade hardware, and after following the instructions from the project repository, you’ll end up with a quantized .gguf file in the model-trained directory ready to use with Podman AI Lab.


== GizmoGobble environment

The development team at GG decided to test 3 of the catalog AI models to determine which was able to respond best to subject specific questions.

 * Instructlab/merlinite-7b-lab-GGUF
 
 * Instructlab/granite-7b-lab-GGUF
 
 * TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF
 
Continue onto the next section to use these models in the playground.
