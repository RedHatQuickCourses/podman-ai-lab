# Podman AI Lab Course

In this course, through the use of Podman Desktop with the AI Lab Extension, students will  experiment with open-source AI models, interacting with integration code examples, and deploying multiple types of AI powered applications using standard laptop / desktop hardware.

In this course you will treat AI Model containerization, Model serving, and Model inference, and template AI Application deployment as a Black Box, handled completely by the Podman application.   

No knowledge of these topics is required, you simply need to to select components from GUI - graphical user interface and let Podman Desktop application handle the rest.

This course will be experienced from the perspective of an Application Developer who works for the ABC corporations. They have been tasked with integrating an AI powered Chatbot into the web interfaces. Our developer will have no experience with AI Models, the Podman Desktop application or understanding of their operation.

This course will progress with the Developer through installing Podman Desktop, Adding the Podman AI Lab extension, Downloading & Serving an AI Model, Using the Playground to experiment & investigate the models knowledge, and finally use template examples to deploy an AI enabled application.
